# **Project:** *"End World Hunger"*
*An open source, distributed micro-farm solution to world hunger.*

***This is a work in progress, and ALL help is appreciated.***

## How it works
The goal is to bring fresh, local produce to markets around the world, no matter what climate zone or location. To do this, a distributed and autonomous system of micro-farms around the world will provide fresh produce year round, no matter what climate. The system is self contained inside a metal shipping container, utilising solar and water reclamation technology to minimize impact of the environment and resources. 

## Proposed Plan
We propose taking a used shipping container, retrofitting climate control equipment to it, and using an automatic watering schedule in conjunction with high efficiency LED lighting to grow plants in any climate.

## Why a shipping container?
Shipping containers typically have a two to three trip lifespan, after which they are usually sold to individuals or scrapped. Shipping containers are also extremely abundant, and available in an assortment of sizes. Easy transportation and mostly water tight construction are the most important key aspects. Using shipping containers allow an inexpensive way to enclose climate control, watering, and lighting equipment inside a sturdy, versatile enclosure.

## What this **is**, and what this **isnt**
This project is **not** intended to:
- Be a self sufficient individual
- Take the human out of growing crops
- Only use one power source (although you could, why would you?)

This project **is** intended to:
- Maximize land-use potential by expanding upwards
- Conserve water, energy, and power when growing crops
- Allow crops to grow year-round with artificial climate control
- Subsidize families and small communities with fresh vegetables year round

## Why develop this?
We believe there is a worldwide epidemic developing where people in climates or locations not suitable for growing crops efficiently are in desperate need for something better. While this won't be a turn-key solution to feed our growing population forever, it is a major start. Instead of a few large farms (or corporations) controlling the majority of the worlds food supply, we can put the power in the hands of people who need it most. 

## How far into development are you?
We are in the research and ideas phase of this project. We have a TON of work ahead of us before we can start to build a proof of concept, but we plan to publish findings, plans, and other progress here.
