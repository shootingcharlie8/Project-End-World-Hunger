# **Project:** *"End World Hunger"*
*An open source, distributed micro-farm solution to world hunger.*

***This is a work in progress, and ALL help is appreciated.***

## How it works
The goal is to bring fresh, local produce to markets around the world, no matter what climate zone or location. To do this, a distributed and autonomous system of micro-farms around the world will provide fresh produce year round, no matter what climate. The system is self contained inside a metal shipping container, utilising solar and water reclamation technology to minimize impact of the envirnment and resources. 

## Proposed Plan
We propose taking a used shipping container, retrofitting climate control equiptment to it, and using an automatic watering schedule in conjunction with high efficiency LED lighting to grow plants in any climate.

## Why a shipping container?
Shipping containers have a two to three trip lifespan, afterwhich they are usually sold to individuals or scrapped. Shipping containters are also extremely abundant, and available in an assortment of sizes. Easy transportation and mostly water tight construction are the most important key aspects. Using shipping containers allow an inexpensive way to enclose climate control, watering, and lighting equiptment inside a sturdy, versatile enclosure. 

## How far into development are you?
We are in the research and ideas phase of this project. We have a TON of work ahead of us before we can start to build a proof of concept, but we plan to publish findings, plans, and other progress here.
